description: COOLPARK is an innovative solution to recreate an oasis, a multifunctional public space for people to destress, take a stroll, kids to play, people to work and hold events. COOLPARK’s science and forward-thinking strategies help to reduce heat. This project was the official entry from NYU Abu Dhabi to Abu Dhabi Muncipality and the James Dyson Award.

# Team
We are a team of 3 undergraduate engineering students passionate about sustainability. The project started with an inspiration from our *Engineers for Social Impact* course under the mentorship of [Prof. Matt Karau](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/matthew-karau.html).

# Inspiration

The resulting high temperatures coupled with Urban Heat Effect have made daily activities, such as simple work-home commutes, outdoor exercises became increasingly difficult and less comfortable for residents like us. We realized that the Urban Heat Island Effect plays a major role in accumulating heat on the island and as an interdisciplinary team, we sought to find solutions to curb heat accumulation on the island. Fortunately, opportunities such as the Dyson Award inspired us to design, innovate, and draw a refreshing public space where Abu Dhabi comes together. Its holistic design and sustainable mindset help lower energy consumption.

# Model
This 40 meter by 8-meter vent efficiently absorbs heat from sunlight, producing convection currents within the structure that force out hot air, thereby producing a vacuum underneath the vent. This vacuum is quickly filled by the surrounding air, creating a cool breeze across the plaza during the day when cooling is most needed. Its effect can help create gentle breezes even to its surrounding buildings, thereby making outdoor life more comfortable. Efficient geothermal vents underneath the structure tap into the year-round coolness of the Earth's crust. Warm air is brought into the geothermal vents, and bypassing underground, it cools down before being exuded into the center of the plaza. This creates a cool-zone in the center of the COOLPARK Plaza. Finally, the iconic winged roof design harnesses natural sea breezes to redirect cool airflow into the plaza.
