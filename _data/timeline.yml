  description: Working with Prof. Debra Laefer to develop a framework for 3D epidemiology for COVID-19 funded by NSF grant. We have developed protocols for risk-identification and sanitation using Thermal Imaging, Machine Learning and HoloLens. Also, we collected Thermal Data of over 100 objects to investigate patterns of disease spread and possible preventive measures.

  description: Worked with Prof. Andras Gyorgy to design of a low-cost 3D printed IoT device to monitor cell growth in Erlenmeyerflasks. Our team simulated simple light refraction models in flasks using COMSOL and using ray-tracing method in MATLAB. We also collaborated with co-peers to interpret the light propagation and fluid dynamics model of the fluid during cell-culture.
