description: Over 1,700 students and faculty gather in Southern New Mexico for the annual Spaceport America Cup every year. Drawn by the opportunity to collaborate and to realise our rocketry dream to come alive, we formed a team at NYU Abu Dhabi to participate in the competition.

# Team
We are a team of 10 undergradatue students consisting of freshmans, sophomores, juniors and seniors. Our team is inter-disciplinary but with a common intrest-**Build and Launch Rockets to Space!**

# Payload 
A set of functional instrumentation, totaling three CubeSat Units (altogether 10.0 cm x 10.0 cm x 30.0 cm) for a total mass of 11.0 lbs, will be mounted on a CubeSat standard form factor adapter. The intrumentation will perform measurements of tropospheric ozone concentrations. In the local context of the UAE previous studies have linked seasonal elevations of ozone concentration in the middle troposphere to emissions from neighboring petrochemical industries. Ozone content is considered a harmful pollutant when found in lower atmosphere. Further sounding of this layer will provide insight into the dynamic atmospheric processes in this region as well as provide evidence for future policy making.

# Recovery 

A dual-deploy recovery system is employed. At 2 seconds after apogee is achieved a dual redundancy barometric altimeter, housed in the main airframe, triggers drogue chute deployment (single canopy, rip-stop nylon, round, D = 3.00 ft). At 800 feet AGL, the second chute (single canopy, rip-stop nylon, round, D = 16.0 ft) is deployed upon being triggered by another dual redundancy barometric altimeter housed in the nosecone section. The main chute has a drag coefficient of at least 0.950 and is tethered by a 20.0 foot tubular nylon shock chord to the main body and nosecone of the rocket. Simulations predict a ground hit velocity of 11.9 fps for this configuration. The on board computer is equipped with a dual redundancy GPS tracker for recovery operations.
