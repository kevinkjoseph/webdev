description: Our proposal known as IRAM was submitted in the‘Tests in Orbit’ Competition organised by UAE Space Agency. Students across the UAE were asked to develop, design and conduct a ‘nano-experiment’ on the effects of microgravity on human health or energy resources. The selected winning projects will be funded and sent to ISS for experimentation.

# Team
We were an interdiscplinary team of 3 undergraduate students with an common interest to conduct experiments in space. Our aim was to understand the effects of gravity on astronauts who were in the early stages of atherosclerosis. We lookef at the immune response and how cells adapted as the stiffness around it changed. Our team was supervised by [Prof. Jeremy Teo](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/jeremy-teo.html).

# Payload 
The size and dimensions of the Nanolab cubesat is 1.5 U 4 in (101.6 mm) x 4 in (101.6 mm) x 5.906 in (150 mm) and mass of 800g in total(without cells and liquids).The Arduino board with an operating voltage of 5V will draw power from the available USB port. Data downlink will be used for storage of environmental parameters for the duration of the experiment. Downlink protocol will include the following data per frame
