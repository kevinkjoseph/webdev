description: The main purpose of the project is to change the attitude of society towards waste. To create a circular economy, we are proposing a combined solution that leverages Microwave Induced Plasma Gasification (MIPG) and Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) technologies as well as youth involvement to turn waste into various valuable resources.

# Team
Our multidisciplinary team is proposing an innovative solution that aims to solve the problem of massive waste generation. Our solution makes use of microwave induced plasma gasification (MIPG) and membrane bioreactors (MBR) as a means to tackle all five types of waste proposed by the SMECEYI competition, namely wastewater, food waste, plastic waste, electronic waste, and construction waste. We are supervised by [Prof. Philip Panicker](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/philip-panicker.html), [Prof. Daniel Johnson](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/daniel-johnson.html).

# Solution 
The main purpose of the project is to change the attitude of society towards waste. To create a circular economy, we are proposing a combined solution that leverages Microwave Induced Plasma Gasification (MIPG) and Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) technologies as well as youth involvement to turn waste into various valuable resources.
Our solution aims to target the agricultural development of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) allowing it to reach its goal of becoming  a leader in the Global Food Security Index by 2051.  Improved performance of the agricultural sector would result in an increase in the production of locally grown crops and fresh produce. This would allow for the UAE to become less reliant on importing crops and fresh produce and would allow for an increase in employment opportunities within agriculture for the youth.  
A future led by empowered, environmentally conscious youth, requires coordinated investment into outreach and education on key pillars of sustainable decisions at the individual and policy level. Implementation of our project will create a culture of commitment to the nation and its environment, keeping each individual invested in and inspired by the role they play. To activate the youthâ€™s full potential, we propose five key avenues: education, start-ups, social media, public messaging, and volunteering opportunities.
